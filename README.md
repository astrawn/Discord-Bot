# Discord-Bot
Code for a simple python driven Discord bot.
This bot is run through the console using the "py *filename*" command.
This file is to be used in tandem with the Discord Developer site where you can create your bot.
You will just need to enter the token for your bot into the token field.
Make sure you do not post this token value anywhere; you should ensure that your bot's token is kept private at all times.

This bot requires discord.py and google packages to be installed.
